# Owners
* Bircu Maxim - GUI with OOP renderer
* Maxian Nicu - CORE Simulation based on cycles and transactions

# What we have implemented in ~ 10h

* Simulate the work of a traffic light for an intersection with 4 traffic lights. 
* The user should be able to increase the speed of traffic light (interval when colors are changed) ( mouse wheel is responsable for this)
* The user may be able to increase the number of generated random cars (ctrl + a - decrease ... ctrl + q - increase....)
* 4 crosswalks
* All rules in intersection are respected ( based on Moldavian Driving Rules )
* Car lights

# How to run
In order to run application you should have Assets folder in same folder as executable.

# Animation
We haven't resolved animation in intersection due lack of time , so there we can seen some interrupts in animation when car crosses intersection. 

# Git
We used git as a Subversion Control and worked on branches master,core,userInterface. Also we have set some tags which are "Release version" (stable version). We can see there 2 tags 1.0 and 1.1. In our repository we can find more than 50 commits.
